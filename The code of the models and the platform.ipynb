      "\u001b[95m## Thought:\u001b[00m \u001b[92mThought: To identify the best customer cluster based on the objective of identifying customers that are at risk of churn and extract their emails, I need to analyze the customer segmentation data provided in the CSV file. The objective is to find customers who are likely to stop using the service, which means I am looking for clusters with descriptions that indicate a potential for churn. Based on the context, cluster_2 with the name \"High Risk\" and description \"Customers with low engagement and high likelihood of churn\" seems to be the most relevant. However, to ensure I'm selecting the correct cluster and extracting the emails correctly, I should use the available tool.\u001b[00m\n",
